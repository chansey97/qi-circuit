;; Catalan numbers

;; Binary trees. In the generating function T for enumerating binary trees, the coeffi-
;; cient of x^n is the number of trees on n nodes. A binary tree is either empty or has
;; one root node and two binary subtrees. There is one tree with zero nodes, so the
;; head term of T is 1. A tree of n + 1 nodes has two subtrees with n nodes total; if
;; one of them has i nodes, the other has n âˆ’ i. Convolution! Convolution of T with
;; itself is squaring, so T^2 is the generating function for the counts of n-node pairs of
;; trees. To associate these counts with n + 1-node trees, we multiply by x. Hence T = 1 + x T^2
;; See Power series, power serious.pdf

;; Let T is the generating function of Catalan numbers, T must satisfy the equation:
;; T = 1 + x T^2
